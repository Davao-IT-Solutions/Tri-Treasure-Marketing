        </p> <p><strong>Use of Cookies</strong></p> <p>
          The Tri-Treasure website use cookies to help you personalise your online experience. A cookie is a text file that is placed on your hard disk by a web page server. Cookies cannot be used to run programmes or deliver viruses to your computer. Cookies are uniquely assigned to you, and can only be read by a web server in the domain that issued the cookie to you.
        </p> <p>
          One of the primary purposes of cookies is to provide convenient features to save you time. The purpose of a cookie is to tell the web server that you have returned to a specific page. For example, if you personalise Tri-Treasure's pages, or register with the Tri-Treasure site or services, a cookie helps Tri-Treasure to recall your specific information on subsequent visits. This simplifies the process of recording your personal information, such as billing addresses, shipping addresses and so on. When you return to the same Tri-Treasure website, the information you previously provided can be retrieved, so you can easily use the Tri-Treasure features that you customised.

          We employ or our third party tracking utility partner employs a software technology called clear gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons/Web Bugs), that help us better manage content on our site by informing us what content is effective. Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of web users. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user’s computer hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on web pages and are about the size of the full stop at the end of this sentence. We do not tie the information gathered by clear gifs to our customers’ personally identifiable information.
        </p> <p><strong>Tracking Technologies</strong></p> <p>
          Tri-Treasure and its partners use cookies or similar technologies to analyze trends, administer the website, track users’ movements around the website, and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole.

        </p> <p><strong>Mobile Analytics</strong></p> <p>
          We use mobile analytics software to allow us to better understand the functionality of our Mobile Software on your phone. This software may record information such as how often you use the application, the events that occur within the application, aggregated usage, performance data, and where the application was downloaded from.
